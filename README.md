# MagicMirror&sup2;

Custom <b>redesigned</b> personal (not to much) smart mirror for iPad 3, iOS 9 & ES5 compatibile Web served version, without fucking local node.js, stupid Retardberry π or other wierd linux shit software, just powered by consistent css & js, fonts sizes, icons & well structured folders, based on <b>MagicMirror&sup2;</b> open source core framework unfortunately <b>full of bugs</b> from amateur "developers"...
