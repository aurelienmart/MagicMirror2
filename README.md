# MagicMirror&sup2;

Custom <b>redesigned</b> personal (not to much) smart mirror for HD monitor + Windows 10 PC stick / HP mini netbook + IKEA frame + see-thru acrylic mirror, powered by consistent css & js, fonts sizes, icons & well structured folders, based on <b>MagicMirror&sup2;</b> https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/develop open source <b>full of bugs</b> core framework & hybrid version 1 + 2 for iPad 3, iOS 9 & ES5 compatibile, with old jquery/PHP <b>bad coded</b> calendar https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/v1.0.0 and piece of shit of RSS newsfeed https://github.com/jangellx/MagicMirror, served from my website page. 

Without fucking local node.js, without stupid Retardberry Pi, without any donation, without pointless or religious nonsens modules and other wierd software from so-called developers struggling to break into a world that has nothing to do with their IQ level, with their free time achievements which remain hidden on an obscure server. And most important without any help from amateur dudes of forum community. When I needed support, no one gave me an answer. They are sometimes so <b>ignorant and incompetent</b> that they don't understand what you're simple asking them, even if it's obvious and not very complicated, but you have to follow they rules, don't be reckless or rude to comment on something, just talking about how supposed to do things in the right way, no hacking, no cheating.
<br><b>NO FUCKING THANK YOU! I HAVE MY OWN RULES!</b>
