# MagicMirror&sup2;

Custom redesigned personal (not so to much) smart mirror for HD monitor + Windows 10 PC stick / HP mini netbook + IKEA frame + see-thru acrylic mirror, powered by consistent css & js, fonts sizes, icons & well structured folders, based on MagicMirror&sup2; https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/develop open source full of bugs core framework & hybrid version 1 + 2 for iPad 3, iOS 9 & ES5 compatibile, with old jquery/PHP bad coded calendar https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/v1.0.0 and piece of shit of RSS newsfeed https://github.com/jangellx/MagicMirror, served from my website page. 

Without fucking local node.js, without stupid Retardberry Pi, without any donation, without pointless and religious nonsense modules or other wierd software from so-called developers struggling to break into a world that has nothing to do with their IQ level, with their achievements which remain hidden on an obscure server. And most important without any help from rude dudes of forum community. When I needed support, no one gave me an answer. They are sometimes so ignorant and incompetent that they don't understand what you're simple asking them, even if it's obvious and not very complicated, but you have to follow they rules and talking about just how supposed to do things in the right way. NO FUCKING THANK YOU!
