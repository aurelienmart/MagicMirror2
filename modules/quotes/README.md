# Module: random_quotes

https://github.com/KirAsh4/random_quotes

The `random_quotes` module returns a random quote based on the category set. Supplied quotes are courtesy
of http://brainyquote.com. Since there is no API for BrainQuote.com, you will have to manually add new ones.
See the section on `Updating Quotes` below.
